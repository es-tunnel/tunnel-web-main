## From Concept To Distibution

Tunnel specializes in high end finishing. Tunnel takes projects from offline editorial through 2K or 4K finishing with every step in between, from color correction, dirt, and scratch removal to high end titling design and visual effects. Tunnel has a powerhouse team to put the finishing touch on your project. In order to maintain the highest level of quality control, Tunnel has brought in-house all of the stages where quality loss can occur. Starting with ingest, be it 4K scanning of RED files conversion, Tunnel ensures the proper attention to detail in the finishing process is given to each project.
